# Wine Quality Prediction

This project aims to predict the quality of wines using various machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this analysis is the Wine Quality dataset, which contains chemical properties and quality ratings of different wines.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/riy4z/wine-quality-predict.git
```

2.Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd wine-quality-predict
```

## Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

1. Navigate to the project directory and open the Wine_Quality_Prediction.ipynb notebook.

Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, train the machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.

##Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Wine Quality dataset, which contains 11 input features (such as acidity levels, pH, alcohol content) and a target variable (quality rating).
